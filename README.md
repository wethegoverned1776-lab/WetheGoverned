# We the People Platform – True Representation, Not Top-Down Governance

**A decentralized platform for verified voters to poll in real time, track metrics of each district within the US, and put forward candidates from the district to represent the people — no party politics.**

## Vision & Goals

The current system concentrates power in parties and distant leaders, leaving ordinary citizens disconnected from the decisions that affect their lives. True democracy requires direct, ongoing input from the people — not just a vote every few years.

This platform envisions a decentralized network where verified voters in every U.S. district can poll instantly on issues, track clear performance metrics, and collectively nominate and instruct representatives who answer to the district alone. By removing party politics from the equation, we return power to "We the People" and rebuild trust in representation.

### Key Features (Planned)
- Decentralized identity for verified district voters
- Binding and non-binding real-time polls on legislation and issues
- Live metrics and scorecards for each congressional district
- Bottom-up candidate selection without party primaries
- Direct instruction channel from district majority to elected representative
- Mobile-friendly interface with notifications for active polls
- Exportable data and transparency reports

### Suggested Tech Stack (Open to discussion)
- Core focus on decentralization and privacy
- Potential use of blockchain/decentralized protocols for voter verification and poll integrity (e.g., Ethereum, Polkadot, or Ceramic)
- Frontend: Next.js or Svelte for responsive, mobile-first design
- Backend: Rust or Go for security-critical components
- Data storage: Combination of decentralized (IPFS) and traditional databases
Community input strongly encouraged — especially on privacy-preserving tech.
